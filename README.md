The progressive neuro-degenerative condition known as Parkinson's disease (PD) affects millions of people worldwide and frequently starts with mild symptoms, such as speech abnormalities. Identifying this disease at an early stage is very vital, especially when vocal impairments start to float. We have traditional diagnostic approaches; However, it falls short in identifying PD during its onset.
In this work, we explore a deep learning method used for classifying PD using voice features which is derived from clinical data. Rather than using raw audio signals, our approach explains numerical voice parameters, which were pre-extracted from already available recordings. We have applied standard pre-processing techniques, which includes feature scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce this complexity and noise in the dataset.
A carefully designed feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) was trained on the reduced feature set. This model, also includes dropout layers and LeakyReLU activation, It has demonstrated an average validation accuracy close to 91% using five-fold cross-validation.
Unlike more complex systems that depend on spectrogram images or recurrent layers like LSTMs, our model is lightweight and works directly with structured data, making it a strong candidate for fast, early PD screening in clinical setting
